  This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had
  recent activity. It will be closed if no further activity occurs. If you believe
  this is a mistake, please reply to this comment to keep it open. If there isn't 
  one already, a PR to fix or at least reproduce the problem in a test case will 
  always help us get back on track to tackle this.
