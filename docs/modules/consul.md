## Why Consul in Junit tests?

With the increasing popularity of Consul and config externalization, applications are now needing to source properties from Consul.
This can prove challenging in the development phase without a running Consul instance readily on hand. This library

test how your application behaves with Consul by writing different test scenarios in Junit.
